# Using RMarkdown

Your TA will introduce R Markdown’s basic formatting syntax along with how to run R code in an R
Markdown document. For PSTAT 10, you should “knit” your result to pdf to upload to Gradescope. To
knit to pdf, you must install the tinytex package:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages('tinytex')
tinytex::install_tinytex()
```

You must also have the following in the metadata header in your RMarkdown document:

```output: pdf_document```

# Problem 1: R Projects and ```here()```

In my experience, even technologically capable students sometimes struggle with their computer’s filesystem.
For this class, I highly recommend you to pick a location on your computer in which to store all class files.
The best practice is to have a dedicated spot for your code and not to use the desktop or downloads folder.

Traditionally, students would tell R where to run their code by getting
(```getwd()```) and setting (```setwd()```) their working directory. You will
find many R scripts that start with ```setwd("absolute/file/path")```. Let's do
this as a rite of passage:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
getwd()
```

By default, the working directory is set to wherever you have your R Markdown
file saved. If you haven't saved your file yet, the working directory will be
your user folder.

You can change your working directory by typing

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Only run one of these, replace the path by a real one
setwd("/path/to/my/directory") # For Mac OS and Linux
setwd("c:/Documents/my/working/directory") # For Windows
```

It is in this directory that R will look for any files that it needs to run your
code.

However, there is a better, more modern way to do this, which makes R projects 
easier to share.

Create an ```R Project``` by selecting ```File > New Project...```. Save the 
project to a dedicated folder of your choice (not in ```Documents``` or 
```Downloads```). Save this R Markdown file in the same folder as your project.

Next, install and load the ```here``` package.

```{r, results='hide', message=FALSE}
# install.packages("here")
library(here)
```

`## here() starts at "path/to/your/project"`


With this package you can use relative file paths instead of absolute file 
paths. This can be very helpful when you collaborate on projects. Your 
collaborator will not have to change their working directory. As soon as they 
have loaded this project, it will _just run_. 

Now, tell R where the root directory (the "lowest" of your folders) is by 
running ```set_here()```. This creates an invisible file .here in your project
directory, which tells R where your root directory is every time you open this
project.

```{r, results='hide', message=FALSE}
set_here()
```

`## File .here already exists in "path/to/your/project"`


Now test ```here```. It converts your relative file path to an absolute one:

```{r, results='hide', message=FALSE}
here()
```

`## [1] "path/to/your/project"`


```{r, results='hide', message=FALSE}
here("week1_files")
```

`## [1] "path/to/your/project/week1_files"`


Yay! ```here``` has set our working directory without us having to get into the
depths of our file system. By adding folders as arguments to ```here```, we can
easily navigate our folders without ever having to explicitly change the 
working directory.

Admittedly, this may seem a bit technical for now (and it is!) but it will help
you in the long run as you pursue a career in data science where you will 
collaborate with others.

# Problem 2: Importing data

Download the file heights.csv from the course website and place it into your working directory. Use
read.csv() to read in the data from the file into an R object. ```here``` will
look for the file ```heights.csv``` in the ```week1_files``` folder.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
heights_df <- read.csv(here("week1_files", "heights.csv"))
summary(heights_df)
## id_. gender age height
## Min. : 1.0 Length:506 Min. :18.0 Min. :143.0
## 1st Qu.:127.2 Class :character 1st Qu.:20.0 1st Qu.:163.0
## Median :253.5 Mode :character Median :21.0 Median :171.0
## Mean :253.5 Mean :22.5 Mean :170.8
## 3rd Qu.:379.8 3rd Qu.:23.0 3rd Qu.:179.0
## Max. :506.0 Max. :61.0 Max. :200.0
```

The object ```heights_df``` is a _data frame_, which we will talk much more about later. For now, know that
summary summarizes the data in a data frame and that the _vector_ called "height" can be accessed with the
dollar sign '$':

```
heights_df$height
```

Find the sum of all the heights in this data frame.
#the function for the question: sum(heights_df["height"])
#the answer for the sum of heights: 86427


# Problem 3: String concatenation

1. Print ```"hello world"``` to the console.
2. Run the following code

```{r, eval = FALSE}
x <- "hello"
y <- "world"
```
#the function used for the question: paste(x, y)
#the outcome: [1] "hello world"


In some languages, adding two strings will concatenate them. In other words, ```x + y``` would return
```"helloworld"```. Does this work in R? Explore the functions `paste` and `paste0` to see how to concatenate
strings in R.

# Problem 4: Vector coercion

You might know from linear algebra that a _vector_ represents change in the form of a magnitude and a
direction, often visualized with an arrow drawn in space. While this idea is useful in R programming as well,
in this class a vector is simply a sequence of values.

_Atomic_ vectors are vectors in which all values are the same data type. The other type of vector is the _list_,
which we may talk about later. Lists can hold elements of different data types.
Create an atomic vector of the elements 1 through 10.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
x <- 1:10
```

Now, change the fifth element of x to be the string ```"cat"```. What happens to the other elements of x?
This is called coercion. Try this with logical data types (TRUE, FALSE) as well and establish the coercion
hierarchy (or just look it up on StackOverflow).

#the function used for the question: replace(x, 5, "cat")
#the outcome: [1] "1"   "2"   "3"   "4"   "cat" "6"   "7"   "8"   "9"   "10" 

#x[6] <- TRUE
#x[7] <- FALSE
# as TRUE is equivalent to 1 and FALSE is equivalent to 0, the final outcome would be:
# "1" "2" "3" "4" "cat" "1" "0" "8" "9" "10

Fun fact: Programming languages that automatically coerce values to a given data
type when incompatible data types are mixed are called _dynamically typed_
(e.g. R, Python), whereas languages which will not coerce values are called
_statically typed_ (e.g. Java, C, C++).
